CAFM System Backend Explanation
Overview
"Let me walk you through our CAFM (Computer-Aided Facility Management) system backend. We've built a robust API using ASP.NET Core that handles all the facility management request operations with a focus on security and efficient ticket routing."

Technology Stack
"For our backend, we're using:

Framework: ASP.NET Core 9.0
Database: SQLite for development (as shown in the connection string in appsettings.json)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API access
Documentation: Swagger UI for easy API testing and documentation"
Key Features
1. User Authentication System
"We've implemented a secure authentication system with:

JWT token-based authentication
Role-based access control with predefined roles:
End User: Can create and view their own tickets
Technicians (Plumber, Electrician, Cleaner): Can view and update tickets in their domain
Asset Manager: Can manage all tickets and assign them to technicians
Admin: Has full system access
Password security with hashing and standard security practices"
2. Ticket Management System
"The core of our system is the ticket management functionality:

Users can create maintenance requests with details like title, description, location
Each ticket is tracked through its lifecycle (Open → In Progress → Completed → Closed)
Tickets have priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical) with corresponding SLAs
The system supports filtering, sorting, and pagination for efficient ticket management"
3. AI-Like Keyword Routing
"What makes our system special is the intelligent ticket routing:

When a user submits a ticket, our system analyzes the text for specific keywords
Based on detected keywords, it automatically categorizes the ticket (Plumbing, Electrical, Cleaning, etc.)
The ticket is then routed to the appropriate department or technician
For example, words like 'leak', 'pipe', or 'water' route to Plumbers, while 'power', 'outlet', or 'electrical' route to Electricians
This reduces manual assignment work and speeds up response times"
4. Auto-Suggestion Feature
"To help users create more specific tickets:

As users type their issue description, the system suggests relevant keywords
These suggestions help users include the right terminology for better routing
The system ranks suggestions by relevance to what the user is typing"
Database Structure
"Our database is currently using SQLite for development, which is a lightweight file-based database. For production, we can easily migrate to SQL Server as the code is already configured to support it.

The main database tables are:

Users: Stores user information and credentials
Roles: Defines system roles and permissions
Tickets: Stores all ticket information including status, category, and assignment
UserRoles: Maps users to their assigned roles"
API Endpoints
"The API is organized into logical controllers:

Auth Controller: Handles user registration, login, and profile management
Tickets Controller: Manages ticket CRUD operations, filtering, and assignment
Both controllers implement proper authorization to ensure data security"
Security Measures
"Security is a priority in our implementation:

All endpoints (except login/register) require authentication
Role-based authorization ensures users only access appropriate resources
JWT tokens expire after 24 hours for security
Password requirements enforce strong passwords
HTTPS is configured for secure data transmission"
Next Steps
"To complete the system, we need to:

Develop the React frontend that will consume this API
Implement real-time notifications using SignalR for new ticket alerts
Set up the production database with SQL Server
Add reporting and analytics features"
